# Discover next-generation hybrid integrations with Edge Integration Cell

Learn about Edge Integration cell, the next-generation hybrid integration runtime offered with SAP Integration Suite, which enables you to manage APIs and run integration scenarios within your local landscape (private cloud or on-premise). 

## Overview

In this session, you will learn how to design integrations and APIs on SAP Integration Suite, and run and monitor them on Edge Integration Cell.

## Pre-requisites

There are no pre-requistes for this hands-on session. You can perform this even if you do not have any experience with integration solutions. However, you will be able to derive a lot of value from this session, if you have some knowledge on what SAP Integration Suite is all about and how it helps with enterprise-wide integration needs.

Here is a mission that can help you getting started with SAP Integration Suite:
