# Discover next-generation hybrid integrations with Edge Integration Cell

Learn about Edge Integration cell, the next-generation hybrid integration runtime offered with SAP Integration Suite, which enables you to manage APIs and run integration scenarios within your local landscape (private cloud or on-premise). 

## Overview

In this session, you will learn how to design integrations and APIs on SAP Integration Suite, and run and monitor them on Edge Integration Cell.

## Pre-requisites

There are no pre-requistes for this hands-on session. You can perform this even if you do not have any experience with integration solutions. However, you will be able to derive a lot of value from this session, if you have some knowledge on what SAP Integration Suite is all about and how it helps with enterprise-wide integration needs.

Here is a mission that can help you getting started with SAP Integration Suite:

## Read this first

It needs to be pointed out that not all portions in today's lab can be performed as a hands-on exercise in the short allotted time. This is owing to the nature of complexity in presenting a 'hybrid' software. As you might have already guessed, installing a container orchestration engine like Kubernetes in an on-premise location from scratch based out of hosted providers like AKS or EKS can be quite daunting from a time, resource, cost, and operations perspective. 

In terms of the software pre-requisites, Account setup, DNS management, etc. there are  hyperscaler, domain, IP, and network dependencies that go beyond SAP's ownership. 

Unfortunately, we cannot have each one of you in the room today to perform a step-by-step installation. Nevertheless, to leave you a fulfilling experience, we have recorded a begin-to-finish video of the installation steps and annotated the timestamps so that you can follow along/play/pause with our step-by-step instructions.
