# Getting Started

Let´s start with an overview of SAP Integration Suite and Edge Integration Cell. This will set the context and help you execute the rest of the exercises.

## What is SAP Integration Suite?

SAP Integration Suite is an Enterprise integration platform-as-a-service (EiPaaS) that helps to quickly integrate on-premise and cloud-based processes, services, applications, events, and data.

## What is Edge Integration Cell and how does it enable Hybrid Integrations?

**Edge Integration Cell** is the new hybrid integration runtime, offered as an optional extension to SAP Integration Suite, enabling customers to run their API-led integration scenarios within customer-managed private landscapes.

- Supports use cases of data compliance and governance by processing data locally
- Route business events from SAP applications to  event brokers
- Configure and manage multiple Edge Integration Cells with an SAP Integration Suite cloud tenant
- Business continuity during temporary connectivity loss (up to 4 hrs)
- Migration path for SAP Process Integration / SAP Process Orchestration customers
