# Exercise 1 - Discover, design and run pre-built standard integration on Edge Integration Cell

In the previous exercise, you have familiarized yourself with the SAP Integration Suite capabilities and navigation. Now let's look at how we can discover, design and run pre-built standard integrations on Edge Integration Cell. In this exercise, we will use a pre-built standard content to connect to an SAP S/4HANA backend system, trigger execution of the content deployed on Edge Integration Cell and perform operations like update of the S/4HANA data objects.

**Note**: For all the subsequent steps in this exercise, please replace the **XX** in **userXX** with your respective id e.g. user99.

##  Configuration & Deployment

After completing these steps, you will have configured and deployed a standard integration on Edge Integration Cell.

1. Navigate back to **Home**. In the Home page, navigate to **Capabilities** and click on **Discover Integrations** under **Build Integration Scenarios** tile.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/home-discover.png)

2.  In the **Discover (Integrations)** view, navigate to the Search text box and enter the following package name, then click Enter:

```yaml 
SAP Order Management Foundation Integration with SAP S/4HANA
```

3. From the list of results, click on the listed package **SAP Order Management Foundation Integration with SAP S/4HANA**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/package-search.png)

4.  In the package detail view, click on **Copy** button placed at top-right corner of the detail view.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/package-copy.png)

5.  In the **Messages** pop-up, click on **Create copy** to create a named copy.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/package-create-copy.png)

6.  In the **Provide suffix** pop-up, enter the username that was provided to you. Clear the existing text which is shown as timestamp and enter username **userXX** with **XX** the number assigned to you, then click **OK**.

8.  Upon confirmation, a toast message **Package copied** will be shown.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/package-copied.png)

9.  Expand **Design** from the navigation pane and click on **Integrations and APIs**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-integration.png)

10.  In the search box, type **userXX** which you used as suffix during package copy operation. Package name with suffix as **.userXX** be listed e.g. **SAP Order Management Foundation Integration with SAP S/4HANA.userXX**. 
Click the listed package and navigate to the Package details view.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-package-select.png)

12.  In the package, click on **Artifacts** tab and click the **Configure** entry from the **Actions** menu of the **Replicate Order from SAP Order Management Foundation to SAP S4HANA** integration flow.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-configure.png)

13.  In the **Configure Selected Artifacts** dialog, change the following parameter under **Sender** tab under **Connection** section. Suffix the **Address** with the **userXX** assigned to you.

```yaml 
/s4onpremise/order_userXX
```

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-configure-sender.png)

14.  Switch to the **Receiver** tab and change the following parameter values:

<br>In the **Address** field, copy and paste: 
```yaml 
https://proxyavrdev.hana.ondemand.com/Proxy/jenkslave55.cpi.c.eu-de-1.cloud.sap/9912/sap/bc/srt/scs_ext/sap/salesorderbulkrequest_in
```

<br> In the **Proxy Type** field choose **Internet** from the drop down menu,

and for **Authentication**, choose **None** from the drop down menu.

After changing the values, click on **Save**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-configure-receiver.png)

15. Ignore the popup with the warnings, and click **Deploy**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-deploy.png)

16.	In the upcoming dialog, select the **Runtime Profile** as **Edge Integration Cell** from the drop-down, since we want to deploy this integration flow to this runtime. And click **Yes**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-deploy-runtime.png)

17.	Click **Ok** on the Deployment confirmation dialog. 

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-deploy-confirm.png)

18.	Once the deployment is successful, a confirmation message will be shown.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/design-iflow-deployed.png)

19.	Click on the entry **Integrations and APIs** from the **Monitor** navigation item on the left pane. From the listed **Runtime**, select **Edge Integration Cell - ...** where the artifact was deployed to.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/monitor-runtime.png)

20.	For the selected Edge runtime, click on tile **All** under **Manage Integration Content**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/monitor-manage-content.png)

21.	Verify that your integration flow is in **Started** state. Check the details like ID; it should be suffixed with your user - **userXX**. If there are too many log entries, you can filter based on your user. **Copy** the generated endpoint into the clipboard.

## Testing

After completing these steps, you will have run a standard integration on Edge Integration Cell connecting to an on-premise SAP S/4HANA system.

**Note**: You have two options to execute and test your integration scenario:
- The quickest option is to use the Bruno API client application for which we have provided a collection with pre-configured sample request. As a prerequisite to test your integration scenario using the Bruno API client, you should have gone through [Prepare - Setup Bruno API client](exercises/prep/). If not, do the setup, then come back and proceed [from here](#option-1-using-bruno-api-client).
- If you like to use your own tool, we have described in detail how to setup a sample request incl. body and authentication. This is described here.

### Option 1: Using Bruno API client

1. Open the Bruno application on your laptop, and select the POST request **Exercise 1 - Replicate Order**. Ensure that the **eu03** environment has been selected. Then trigger a message by selecting the **Send Request** button on the upper right.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/bruno-send-request.png)

2.	Upon success, you will receive **200 OK** status as a response. Copy the **message ID** from the response message into the clipboard.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/bruno-send-successful.png)

3. Switch back to the SAP Integration Suite UI, and navigate to the monitoring overview page.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/monitor-overview.png)

4. Navigate to tile **All Artifacts** under **Monitor Message Processing**.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/monitor-messages-tile.png)

5.	Search the corresponding message processing log using the **message ID** copied beforehand by putting it in the ID search box and click enter. A completed message processing entry will be shown against the **Message ID** if message processing was successful.

<br>![](/exercises/ex3/images/monitor-messages-completed.png)

Scroll down to proceed to the next exercise.

### Option 2: Using your own API client

1.	Open your own API client and create a new **POST** request.

2. Define the payload of type JSON as follows.

3. To authenticate to the Cloud Integration runtime, select **Basic Authentication** and maintain the credentials as follows.

<br>User name =
```yaml
sb-3009327f-3dc1-4e3e-9853-5bd7c23e221d!b44358|it-rt-cpisuite-europe-03!b18631
```
<br>Password = 
```yaml 
e507568e-892c-443f-a6ba-4d53f76fecac$wS5Kq2nV25PlNT-U8bh8Yd-HGoBZpO-XW7Za9X3URE0=
```

4.	Trigger a message. Upon success, you will receive **200 OK** status as a response. Copy the **message ID** from the response **message** to the clipboard.
5.	For monitoring the message in the message monitor of SAP Integration Suite, see above.

## Summary

You've now completed the following:
1. Discover and use standard integration content
2. Configure and deploy it on Edge Integration Cell
3. Send message to the backened system using an Integration flow
